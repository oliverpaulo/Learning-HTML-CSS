			<p>Red Velvet (Korean: 레드벨벳; RR: Redeubelbet) is a South Korean girl group formed and managed by SM Entertainment. They originally debuted on 
			August 1, 2014, with the single "Happiness" with the four-member line-up of Irene, Seulgi, Wendy and Joy. A fifth member, Yeri, joined the group in March 2015, following the release of their

			first mini album, Ice Cream Cake. Musically, the work of Red Velvet reflects their own group name: their predominantly-pop "red" side experiments occasionally with electronic, funk and hip hop, while their "velvet" side focuses on '90s-influenced R&B with elements of ballad and jazz. Their genre versatility and hooks have garnered critical praise. </p>
			
			<p> The group's Korean-language discography includes two studio albums, one reissue album, one compilation album, and ten extended plays—eleven of which have topped the South Korean Gaon Album Chart. Their hit singles "Red Flavor" and "Power Up" reached number one on the Gaon Digital Chart. Numerous others charted both in the Gaon Digital Chart and the Billboard World Digital Song Sales chart including "Happiness", "Ice Cream Cake", "Dumb Dumb", "One of These Nights", "Russian Roulette", "Rookie", "Peek-a-Boo", "Bad Boy", "RBB (Really Bad Boy)", "Zimzalabim", "Umpah Umpah", "Psycho", and "Queendom". The group also ventured into the Japanese music scene with the extended plays #Cookie Jar (2018) and Sappy (2019).</p>
